    __ENHANCEMENT-FUN-PAUSE__: The addition of a pause button that when pressed, if and only if a program is executing, pauses the program on the current operation. The stack, output, program counter, and elapsed execution time shall be preserved. Once pressed, the user may resume the program's execution from the current operation using any of the 'Run', 'Walk', or 'Mosey' functions. The user may also use the 'Stop' function during a pause.
